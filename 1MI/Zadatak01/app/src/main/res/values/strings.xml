    <string name="text">The Isuzu MU is a mid-size SUV that was produced by the Japan-based manufacturer Isuzu. The three-door MU was introduced in 1989, followed in 1990 by the five-door version called Isuzu MU Wizard, both of which stopped production in 1998 to be replaced by a second generation. This time, the five-door version dropped the "MU" prefix, to become the Isuzu Wizard. The acronym "MU" is short for "Mysterious Utility". Isuzu manufactured several variations to the MU and its derivates for sale in other countries.</string>
